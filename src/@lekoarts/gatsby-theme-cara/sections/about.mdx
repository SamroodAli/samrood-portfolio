## About me
### A Full Stack Web Developer obsessed with how things work.
<p>
A Stoic and a Software developer. I wish to apply the principles of stoicism to both life and software development. I fell in love with programming during the corona lockdowns. I love philosophy and read self-help books in my spare time.
I am more interested in the science behind or inner engineering of all technologies I come across and haven't limited myself to any "stack". Though I am learning both MERN stack as well Ruby on rails now, I can pick up any stack necessary or fun.
